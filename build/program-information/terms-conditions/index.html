        <p>The following information forms an important part of
the enrolment process. Children can not participate in
any aspect of the program unless
their parent/guardian has acknowledged the terms and
conditions, privacy policy and release.</p>

<h2 id="terms-amp-conditions">Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>

<p><strong>Parent/guardian role at the location</strong>:
parents/guardians are expected to remain at the location at all
times during their child’s participation in their designated
class.</p>

<p><strong>Handover/duty of care:</strong> when arriving at the
location, the parent/guardian should take their child to their
designated instructor and ensure that their child’s name is marked
‘in’ on the attendance sheet for that day. No child will be
accepted more than 10 minutes before the start of their designated
class. After class, the instructor will ensure that the child is
released directly into the care of the parent/guardian before
marking the child ‘out’ on the attendance sheet and allowing them
to leave the location.</p>

<p><strong>Refund policy</strong>: if a location is cancelled for
any reason you may request a full refund or transfer your children
to an alternative location. If classes are cancelled due to extreme
weather or for any other reason they will be rescheduled where
possible, however if circumstances dictate that rescheduling is not
possible refunds for a pro-rata proportion of the enrolment fee
will be made. Refunds for children unable to attend classes due to
medical reasons, will only be issued if a participant attends no
more than 2 days of the program.</p>

<p><strong>Medical:</strong> To claim a medical refund, parents
must send a letter outlining the number of days attended together
with a medical certificate and a copy of the program receipt.
Requests for medical refunds must be received by the VACSWIM office
no later than 1<sup>st</sup> February 2015. The pool entry fee,
where applicable, will not be refunded for medical refunds where
the child has attended part of the program. Cancellation of On Line
registration for reasons other than medical conditions will incur
an administration fee of $30.  Refund requests for on line
bookings will only be accepted until 18<sup>th</sup> December,
2014.</p>

<p><strong>Transferring between locations:</strong> transferring
from one location to another is possible, however children will
only be accommodated if a vacancy exists at the new location.
Children transferring to another location will not be given
additional instruction to the detriment of the existing
participants. An enrolment receipt and certificate of participation
signed by the instructor in charge of the original location must be
produced when enrolling at the new location. For further
clarification about transferring between locations, please speak to
the instructor in charge or the VACSWIM office.</p>

<p><strong>Medical conditions:</strong> if your child has a medical
condition, for example asthma, attention deficit disorder,
diabetes, epilepsy and/or others (state clearly), it must
be written and detailed in the ‘child details section’ of the
enrolment form. If necessary, please include additional
information/notes in the child details section, providing a
detailed explanation of your child’s medical condition. Please
note that under no circumstances will VACSWIM instructors or
volunteers administer any medicines.</p>

<p><strong>Children with a disability:</strong> children with a
disability are encouraged to participate in the VACSWIM program.
When enrolling, the Instructor in Charge should be informed of any
additional needs your child requires to enable participation.
Participation is conditional upon the VACSWIM location being able
to provide the additional support services arranged through
consultation between the Instructor in Charge and the parent or
caregiver. This will ensure a responsible person is keeping the
child under observation at all times. Please indicate in the
child details section if your child is regarded as having a
disability and complete the medical information on the back of the
form. Parents and/or caregivers are encouraged to attach a
note providing further explanation if required.</p>

<p><strong>Code of Behaviour:</strong> participants (in and out of
the water) are expected to cooperate with the instruction and
direction of VACSWIM staff. Instructors are responsible for the
children directly involved in their class while the class is being
conducted. Inappropriate disruptive behaviour could result in
exclusion from class(es). Instructors are not responsible for the
general supervision of others at the location. Parents should
ensure that appropriate supervision is provided at all other
times.</p>

<p><strong>Skin care:</strong> VACSWIM encourages all participants
to wear a t-shirt and hat, and apply 30+ sunscreen. Failing to
provide suitable skin protection could result in exclusion from a
class.</p>

<p><strong>Preferred times:</strong> whilst every possible effort
will be taken to comply with requests for preferred class times, we
do not guarantee that these times will be available.</p>

<h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>In accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 and, Privacy
Amendent (Private Sector) Act 2000 all information collected
and stored on the VACSWIM student database will only be used for
the purpose, nature and duration of the VACSWIM program. There will
not be any disclosure of any information collected or stored on the
VACSWIM student database to a third party for any reason other than
medical related situations unless there has been prior written
consent.</p>

<h2 id="release">Release</h2>

<p><strong>This section forms a crucial part of the enrolment
process and must be signed/acknowledged when enrolling your
children.</strong></p>

<p>As parent/guardian of the child listed on the enrolment form, I
declare that the information I have provided is true and correct. I
give my consent for him/her to participate in the 2015 VACSWIM
program and agree to delegate my authority to the supervising
instructors.</p>

<p>If my child requires medical treatment as a result of an
emergency or accident, and contact with me is impracticable or
impossible, I authorise the VACSWIM staff to arrange whatever
medical assistance is necessary. I will pay all medical and dental
expenses incurred on behalf of my child. I have detailed on the
enrolment form health care information including details of any
additional health support he/she requires to safely participate in
the 2015 VACSWIM program.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that I have read and understood the terms and
conditions for participating in the 2015 VACSWIM program and
agree that my child will comply with the VACSWIM rules, standards
and requirements. I agree to abide by the VACSWIM refund policy
outlined in the terms and conditions. I acknowledge that my child
participates at his/her own risk and will not hold the Minister for
Recreation and Sport or employees or volunteers of the YMCA of
SA liable for any accident, injury, property, loss or cost
occurring as a result of participating in the 2015 VACSWIM program
unless caused by negligence or a wrongful act or omission by the
Minister for Recreation and Sport or employees or
volunteers of the YMCA of SA.</p>

<p><strong>Photograph Release:</strong> I agree to allow the
VACSWIM office and the YMCA of South Australia to use any
photographs taken during the course of the program for future
promotions or reporting purposes in any media with regards to
promoting water safety awareness <em>(you will be given the option
to agree or decline to this section).</em></p>
