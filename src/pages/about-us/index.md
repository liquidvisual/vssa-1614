## A South Australian water safety icon

Established around the 1950's, VACSWIM has become a household name in the state of South Australia. Each year, the program engages up to 18,000 school aged children at more than 145 locations across the state. **Put simply, VACSWIM's aim is to reduce the incidence of drowning amongst the younger generations.**

Supported by SA Water, Channel 9, Mix 102.3 and Valeant Pharmaceuticals (Hamilton Sunscreens), the program works with key stakeholders - Office for Recreation & Sport, Royal Life Saving Society Australia (SA) and Surf Life Saving South Australia - to teach water safety and survival skills that may one day, they may save a life.

## Swimming lessons, water safety, water survival

Did you know that 315 people drowned between the 1st July 2010 and 30th June 2011 and that more than 40% of these people were under 34 years of age? If you think that this is an alarming statistic, you're not alone. Thankfully, VACSWIM exists to reduce these statistics by teaching younger generations to intervene in these unfortunate, and often life threatening situations.

Enjoy a lifetime of safe recreation on, in and around the water by [enrolling](/vacswim-locations/) your children in the 2015 SA Water VACSWIM program.
