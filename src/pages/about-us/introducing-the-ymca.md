## YMCA Mission

YMCA's of Australia work together from a base of Christian values to provide opportunities for all people to grow in body, mind and spirit.

## YMCA Values

We value people, leadership, partnerships, courage and service. We value behaviours that reflect honesty, respect and integrity. The YMCA of South Australia is guided to achieve its mission by the following Christian values:

- The dignity and intrinsic worth of all people regardless of age, gender, ethnicity or belief
- The whole person, consisting of a body, mind and a spirit, each of which is of equal importance
- Healthy communities based on relationships between people which are characterised by love, understanding, mutual respect and a sense of belonging
- Equality of opportunity and justice for all people</div>
- The diversity of people, communities and nations</div>
- Acceptance of personal responsibility

These core values translate into four key operational values: **honesty, respect, caring, responsibility.** For more information or to join the YMCA of South Australia, please visit their website [www.sa.ymca.org.au](http://www.sa.ymca.org.au/) or call (08) 8200 2500 today.
