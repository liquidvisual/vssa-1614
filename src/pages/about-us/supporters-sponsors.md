<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>South Australian Water Safety
Committee.</strong> Water safety is an important issue for
Australians, particularly with our enjoyment of water-based
activities like swimming, fishing and boating. In South Australia,
the prevention of water-related injuries and drowning deaths is a
high priority. While our state has maintained relatively low
numbers of drowning deaths, all drownings are considered
preventable. With that in mind, it is essential that a coordinated
approach between relevant industry, recreational and general
interest bodies regarding water safety is maintained.</p>

range of issues that result in drowning deaths.</p>

<p>Today's world of modern technology, increased reliance on
motorised transport, and increased demands at work and home,
amongst other factors, has meant that as a community, we do much
less physical activity than we used to.In fact, only half of South
Australian adults are doing enough physical activity, and there has
also been a concerning decline in the level of physical activity in
children as well. <strong><em><strong><em><strong>be
active</strong></em></strong></em></strong> is a South Australian
message established by the State Government to get more South
Australians more active, more often. With such a fantastic state in
which to <em><strong><em><strong>be
active</strong></em></strong></em>, there are many opportunities
for all of us!</p>
