##Positive Feedback

Each year we receive many wonderful letters from the participants and their families so here's a few of our favourites from the 2014 SA Water VACSWIM program which ran this year.

*Brad the head of Gawler vac swim was excellent and most helpful when I had to sort out times on the 1st day as my boys were put in completely different time , I think because they have different last names so weren't recognised as siblings . He also tried to help my older son alot. Tom Byrnes my younger sons instructor was brilliant, I've never seen a class of 6- 8yr olds listen so well ! They all did well and loved him as an instructor.*

Kerry - Gawler Swimming Centre

*My daughter's instructors were excellent and I was particularly impressed with how efficiently they moved from one activity to the next, making excellent use of the time (and making sure they didn't get too cold waiting).*

Anon - Norwood Outdoor Swimming Centre

*The young swim instructors at Renmark were fantastic. The young man whose name I cant remember sorry, was just brilliants. Loud, firm, clear, fun, adaptable. He was excellent.*

Karen - Renmark Swimming Pool

*Excellent program - after the week my son was so enthusiastic he can now swim without floaties!*

Anon - Magill Pool Uni SA

*My child has disabilities and needs one-to-one instruction. This was handled very well at the Magill pool, thanks to the excellent organization of Maurice.*
