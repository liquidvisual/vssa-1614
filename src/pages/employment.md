## Kickstart Your Career by Participating in One of SA's Largest Community Events!

The annual VACSWIM program is a South Australian Government funded program managed by the YMCA of South Australia. Each year it engages up to 14,000 primary school aged children at more than 125 sites across the state. VACSWIM's aim is to reduce the incidence of drowning amongst the younger generations.

2015 VACSWIM will be delivered by four different bodies of water safety experts. Royal Life Saving will deliver majority of the programs at pools. Surf Life Saving SA will deliver all programs at the beach or open water. YMCA of SA will deliver all programs at YMCA of SA pools. Various independent pool sites will deliver their own programs. Please see the [VACSWIM Locations Page](/vacswim-locations/) to discover what organisation will be running specific sites.

All staff who worked in the 2014 program are encouraged to re-apply by contacting the program providers specific to their site.

2015 VACSWIM providers will **start appointing eligible instructors in September 2014**, continuing this process until all positions/sites have been filled.
