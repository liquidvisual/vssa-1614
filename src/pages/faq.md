<p><strong>What is VACSWIM?</strong></p>

<p>VACSWIM is a Government of South Australia initiative that aims
to provide opportunities for primary school aged children to learn
about water safety.&nbsp; There are three water safety programs
within VACSWIM; Swim and Survive is a Royal Life Saving Society
program and takes place in swimming pools, Surf and Survive is a
Surf Life Saving South Australia program and takes place on
beaches, AquaSafe is the YMCA program and takes place in YMCA
swimming pools.</p>

<p><strong>When does VACSWIM take place?</strong></p>

<p>The majority of programs take place from Tuesday 3rd to
Wednesday 11th January&nbsp;however, for specific location details,
check the <a href="/vacswim-locations/" title="VACSWIM Locations / Enrolments">locations page</a> and
search for the site you plan on attending.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>How do I find out if there is a VACSWIM location near
me?</strong></p>

<p>All the locations are listed <a href="/vacswim-locations/">here</a></p>

<p><strong>What level should my child be doing?</strong></p>

<p>The first thing to do is decide whether you'll be doing VACSWIM
on a beach or in a pool.&nbsp; Then check out the content of the <a href="/program-information/providers-and-programs/slssa-surf-survive/">
Surf and Survive</a> program (beaches) or <a href="/program-information/providers-and-programs/rlss-sa-swim-survive/">
Swim and Survive</a> or <a href="/program-information/providers-and-programs/ymca-water-safety-course/">
YMCA's</a> programs<a href="/program-information/providers-and-programs/ymca-water-safety-course/" title="YMCA Water Safety Course">.</a> Each program are levelled
or staged and if you did 3 last year you'll be doing 4 this
year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All children will be assessed at the first session after which
the instructor will suggest a different level or not</p>

<p><strong>My child did it on a beach last year, can they do it in
a pool this year?</strong></p>

<p>Absolutely!&nbsp; The levels/stages are pretty consistent so if
you did Stage 4 on the beach last year you'd probably be doing
Level 5 in the pool this year.</p>

<p><strong>What time will my level take place?</strong></p>

<p>In many locations you can chose the program time.&nbsp; In other
locations the provider (Royal Life Saving, Surf Life Saving or
YMCA) will be in touch to confirm the time as they consider the
number of bookings for each level.&nbsp; It is likely they won't be
in touch until after enrolments close on 20<sup>th</sup>
December.</p>

<p><strong>I've forgotten what level my child did last
year?</strong></p>

<p>You will need to contact the program provider.&nbsp; If you did
it last year in a swimming pool it's likely that Royal Life Saving
has them (8210 4500) or if it was in a YMCA pool call them on 8406
2900.&nbsp; If it was on a beach then contact Surf Life Saving on
8354 6996.</p>

<p><strong>How do I find out about the cost of doing a VACSWIM
program?</strong></p>

<p>While the enrolment fee of $30 is standard for all programs as
is an equipment fee of $1.50, the location fee changes from
location to location.&nbsp; All fee info is on the Location page
within the Enrolment section of the web site.</p>

<p><strong>How do I book a VACSWIM program?</strong></p>

<p>Most locations operate on line bookings. When you book a VACSWIM
program you will book with the program provider not VACSWIM.&nbsp;
Each program provider has their own booking system.&nbsp; Please
note:</p>

<p><em>For the <strong>Royal Life Saving</strong> booking portal,
please remember to hit the 'Add Participant' button after you have
filled in the details of your child</em></p>

<p><em>For the <strong>YMCA</strong> booking portal, do not worry
that under 'Teacher' it says Angaston.&nbsp; Just select the level
you want and keep going.</em></p>

<p><strong>Can I book at the location?</strong></p>

<p>Many locations will have an on-site booking day.&nbsp; To find
out if your location will be having one you should check the
information page for that location.&nbsp; If there is no
information on the page about on-site booking please contact the
number for the program provider that will be in red at the top of
the location information page.</p>

<p><strong>Can I cancel my booking?</strong></p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; To do this you should call the program provider.</p>

<p><strong>What age can children do VACSWIM?</strong></p>

<p>If you want to do VACSWIM on a beach, your child must be 5 years
old by the start of the program.&nbsp; If you want to do it in a
pool your child must be 5 years old on or before 30<sup>th</sup>
April 2016.</p>

<p>While VACSWIM is for primary school aged children, the program
providers do have some parallel programs.&nbsp; For beaches,
children aged up to 17 can enrol in the &nbsp;Holiday Program which
can be booked through Surf Life Saving South Australia's&nbsp;
VACSWIM booking system. &nbsp;They also have the Little Lifesavers
and Surf Babies programs, running at different times and dates to
VACSWIM.&nbsp; Further details can be found <a href="http://www.surflifesavingsa.com.au/main/news/2015/08/surf-babies-and-little-lifesavers/">
here.</a></p>

<p>If you are looking for something in a pool please check <a href="http://www.royallifesavingsa.com.au/swimandsurvive/">here</a>
or call 8210 4500.</p>

<p><strong>Can I drop my child, go and get a coffee and come back
later?</strong></p>

<p>Terms and conditions state that you should stay at the location
while your child is involved with the program.</p>

<p><strong>Could a &nbsp;VACSWIM session be cancelled due to hot
weather or bush fire potential?</strong></p>

<p>Sessions will not be cancelled due to hot weather.&nbsp;
Locations that are declared catastrophic fire areas will be
cancelled and this is updated at 4.00pm by the CFS the day before
and all parents/staff are notified.&nbsp;Make up lessons are held
if possible.</p>

<p><strong>How will I know if a session is going to be
cancelled?</strong></p>

<p>The Program Provider will let people know with a combination of
email and/or sms.&nbsp; There will also be Facebook posts as
well.&nbsp; It is crucial that people add the program provider's
email address to their safe sender list to stop the possibility of
it going to Junk.</p>

<p><strong>If I can't attend all session, can my child complete the
program</strong></p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; If you know you will not be able to attend one of
more session please inform the Instructor in Charge on the first
day. This will allow the Instructors to prepare in advance for your
child to complete all the competencies.</p>

<p><strong>Can parents enter pools for free?</strong></p>

<p>It is best to check with the location in advance.</p>
