## Savvy Marketing

Facebook is a great way to keep in touch with us - you can leave us a message, chat to us when we're online or browse through our impressive photo collection. Facebook is also used by our savvy marketing team to broadcast date changes, new sites, interesting facts and new and exciting program developments.

**Follow us on facebook and WIN!**

Each month we'll be giving away a YMCA 'Swim Pack' complete with a swimming bag, swimming cap and goggles to one lucky family who enrols online! What's more, if you're the winner of our monthly draw and you're following us on facebook, your children will participate in the 2015 SA Water VACSWIM program for **FREE** - that's right, that's a saving of $30.00 per child! So what are you waiting for, enrol online then find us on facebook! *(terms and conditions apply).*
