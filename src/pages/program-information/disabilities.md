## Everyone Counts

**Children with a disability are encouraged to participate
in the annual VACSWIM program.**

The instructor in charge should be consulted when enrolling a
child with a disability. If participation is conditional upon
special precautions being taken, the child can only attend
classes if additional supervision can be arranged through
consultation between the instructor in charge and the parent or
caregiver (this will ensure a responsible person is keeping the
child under observation at all times).

If your child has a disability, please indicate the
disability on the enrolment form and attach a note explaining the
assistance your child may require. For any further queries
regarding this or any other aspect of the 2015 VACSWIM program,
please contact our friendly office staff on (08) 8200
2525 or [vacswimsa@ymca.com.au](mailto:vacswimsa@ymca.com.au).

## YMCA's Recreation Link-up

Being involved in recreation is an integral part of a healthy
lifestyle and is important to a person's sense of value and
identity. Aside from the annual VACSWIM program, the YMCA's
Recreation Link-up service enhances the quality of life for
people with a disability by supporting participation in sport, arts
and other recreational activities of their choice.

Recreation Link-up is a service that provides recreational
planning, information, education and introductory assistance to
people with a disability. If there is an activity you would like to
try, some people you would like to meet, or if you would like to
know what is available in your community, Recreation Link-up can
assist you.
