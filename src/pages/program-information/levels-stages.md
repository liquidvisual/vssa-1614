## YMCA AquaSafe Levels

YMCA AquaSafe is so much more than just a water safety course.
We believe that values and skills learned early on are vital
building blocks for life!

Our qualified and friendly teachers show children the safest way
to enjoy all water activities. YMCA AquaSafe has been developed to
provide the opportunity for participants to gain swimming and water
safety skills together with confidence around the water. These
skills will not only apply to their swimming and water safety, but
can also help build positive relationships, leading to good
sportsmanship and teamwork.
