## Program Fees

The VACSWIM program fee consists of two parts;

**Enrolment Fee:** In 2015, the
enrolment fee will be $30.00 per child.

**Large family Discounts: **
Families that have 4 or more children are entitled to a
large family discount. The large family program fees are
capped at $100.00 (excluding SLSSA 'Surf & Survive' Level
10).

**GST:** the VACSWIM Program is GST
free.

**Equipment & Location Fee:** In
addition to the enrolment fee, some locations charge an Equipment
& Location Fee to assist with the costs associated with
provisions of equipment, first aid, etc. Concessions or large
family discounts do not apply to this fee. This fee is GST
exempt.

## Pool Entry Fees

In addition to the program fees mentioned above,
some locations charge a daily entry fee which is **paid
direct to the pool/venue** during the program (do not pay
this fee to VACSWIM when enrolling your child).

_PLEASE NOTE: Some sites waive the daily entry
fee for pool members. To enquire about pool memberships and/or
season passes, please contact your local pool, lake or
school._

## SLSSA 'Surf & Survive' Level 10

Children participating in the SLSSA 'Surf
& Survive' Level 10 will **incur an additional
cost** for program manuals which must be given to
the Instructor in Charge at the location. Payments can be made by
cash, money order or cheque (cheques must be payable to SLSSA).
